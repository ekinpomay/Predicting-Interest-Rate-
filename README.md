Predicting Interest Rate

1 Preliminary Steps
o Set up a jupyter notebook in MS Azure
o Set up the necessary compute instances in MS Azure
o Upload the dataset in MS Azure (play a little bit around with Azure datastores and
read the available help)
o Clean the dataset
o Select the variables shown in the table above
2. Data Understanding
o Analyze the variables in dataset you selected (Schema, First rows, Descriptive
Statistics / Frequency Tables, (Charts), …
3. Data Preparation
o Missing Values
o Transformation of all categorical variables
o Split into Test and Training Dataset
o …
4. Modeling
o Model with target variable: Interest rate
§ Model 1: Multiple Linear Regression
§ Model 2: Hyperparameter Tuning / Grid Search
• Run at least 10 models with different hyperparameters
• Identify the most promising model
o Evaluate all Model Fits
§ Core Parameter is Coefficient of Determination R2
§ Always control for overfitting (just compare training and test datasets and
reduce the complexity of the models if necessary)
§ Check the distribution of the error part
o Report a final model which fits best to the data (due to R2 and overfitting).
5. Management Presentation
o Present the core finding on a maximum of 5 slides (only for this task!). Summarize
core findings.
